The grocery tracker tracks the current inventory of item, the histogram of items, and searches for the item in the inventory.
I feel that the code is pretty clean and easily understood. I realized that I could have used "using namespace std" to reduce the traffic of the code.
I could have probably inserted a class to have a better code that is easier to be understood once they understand the prupose of that class.
I found that printing the histogram to be the hardest because I wasn't familiar with that type of code and had many trial and errors before I figured it out.
I looked up how to create histogram with C++ in different ways and looked in Stack Overflow and Youtube videos to have a better grasp of the histogram as I programmed it.
The skill of using text files as it was the first time reading a file, using the data stored in it and then finally closing it.
I added comments to make the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
